This is a react project which shows OCR functionality - 
OCR - Optical Character Recognition

Code Explanation:
A React component that allows a user to upload an image of a bill, extract text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Tesseract.js, and display specific details from the bill such as Bill Number, Due Date, Total Amount, and Payee Name.

Why Tesseract was the Best Option:
Accuracy for Printed Text: Tesseract is one of the most accurate OCR libraries, especially for printed text on bills.
Free and Open-Source: Tesseract is open-source, meaning it is cost-effective and can be freely used in commercial applications.
JavaScript Support: Since the application is built in React, Tesseract.js provides an easy integration in the browser environment for client-side OCR tasks.
Extensibility: Tesseract supports multiple languages and can be trained for specific fonts or text types, which is important for different kinds of bills.
