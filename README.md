This is a react project which shows OCR functionality - 
OCR - Optical Character Recognition

Code Explanation:
A React component that allows a user to upload an image of a bill, extract text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Tesseract.js, and display specific details from the bill such as Bill Number, Due Date, Total Amount, and Payee Name.

Here's a line-by-line breakdown:

Imports:

import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";
import Tesseract from "tesseract.js";
import { Box, Button, Typography } from "@mui/material";
React is the main library for building the user interface.
useState is a React hook used to manage the state of variables like image, extracted text, and bill details.
useCallback is a hook that helps optimize performance by memoizing the drop callback function.
useDropzone is a hook from the react-dropzone library that provides drag-and-drop file upload functionality.
Tesseract.js is a JavaScript library for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) that converts text from an image into readable text.
Box, Button, Typography are Material UI components used to build the UI (for layout, buttons, and text styling).
State Variables:

const [image, setImage] = useState(null);
const [extractedText, setExtractedText] = useState("");
const [billDetails, setBillDetails] = useState({});
image: Stores the image URL of the uploaded file.
extractedText: Stores the OCR text extracted from the image.
billDetails: Stores the specific details extracted from the OCR text (e.g., Bill Number, Due Date, Amount).
Dropzone Setup:

const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles) => {
  const file = acceptedFiles[0];
  if (file) {
    setImage(URL.createObjectURL(file));
    setExtractedText("");
    setBillDetails({});
  }
}, []);
This is a callback function triggered when a file is dropped into the dropzone.
acceptedFiles: Contains the file(s) uploaded by the user.
It only takes the first file, creates a URL for it, and updates the image state.
The extractedText and billDetails states are reset to empty.
Dropzone Component:

const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
  onDrop,
  accept: "image/*",
  maxFiles: 1,
});
useDropzone provides props (getRootProps, getInputProps) that are used to configure the drag-and-drop functionality.
It only accepts image files (image/*), and a maximum of one file.
Text Extraction Function:

const handleExtractText = async () => {
  if (!image) return;
  try {
    const { data: { text } } = await Tesseract.recognize(image, "eng");
    setExtractedText(text);
    extractBillDetails(text);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error extracting text:", error);
  }
};
handleExtractText is an async function that uses Tesseract to extract text from the uploaded image.
Tesseract.recognize takes the image URL and language ("eng" for English) and returns the extracted text.
If successful, it updates the extractedText state and passes the extracted text to extractBillDetails to parse the specific details.
Extract Bill Details:

const extractBillDetails = (text) => {
  const billNumberMatch = text.match(/Bill Number[:\s]+(\d+)/i);
  const dueDateMatch = text.match(/Due Date[:\s]+([\w-]+)/i);
  const amountMatch = text.match(/Total Amount[:\s]+₹?([\d,.]+)/i);
  const payeeMatch = text.match(/Payee Name[:\s]+(.+)/i);

  setBillDetails({
    billNumber: billNumberMatch ? billNumberMatch[1] : "Not Found",
    dueDate: dueDateMatch ? dueDateMatch[1] : "Not Found",
    totalAmount: amountMatch ? ₹${amountMatch[1]} : "Not Found",
    payeeName: payeeMatch ? payeeMatch[1] : "Not Found",
  });
};
This function uses regular expressions to search for specific patterns in the OCR text.
It looks for "Bill Number", "Due Date", "Total Amount", and "Payee Name" in the text.
If a match is found, the corresponding bill details are extracted and saved in the billDetails state.
UI Components:

Dropzone Area:
<Box {...getRootProps()} sx={{ border: "2px dashed gray", padding: "20px", cursor: "pointer", marginBottom: 2 }}>
  <input {...getInputProps()} />
  <Typography>Drag & Drop a bill image here, or click to select one</Typography>
</Box>
This renders the drop area where users can either drag and drop an image or click to select one.
Image Preview:
{image && <img src={image} alt="Uploaded" style={{ maxWidth: "100%", height: "auto", marginBottom: "10px" }} />}
If an image is uploaded, its preview is displayed.
Extract Button:
<Button variant="contained" color="primary" onClick={handleExtractText} disabled={!image}>
  Extract Bill Details
</Button>
A button that triggers text extraction when clicked, but it’s disabled if no image is uploaded.
Display Extracted Bill Details:
{extractedText && (
  <Box sx={{ textAlign: "left", marginTop: 2 }}>
    <Typography variant="h6">Extracted Details:</Typography>
    <Typography><strong>Bill Number:</strong> {billDetails.billNumber}</Typography>
    <Typography><strong>Due Date:</strong> {billDetails.dueDate}</Typography>
    <Typography><strong>Total Amount:</strong> {billDetails.totalAmount}</Typography>
    <Typography><strong>Payee Name:</strong> {billDetails.payeeName}</Typography>
  </Box>
)}
If any text has been extracted, the bill details (Bill Number, Due Date, Total Amount, Payee Name) are displayed.

Use Case in Project:
Use Case: A banking application needs to help users extract details from bills (e.g., utility bills, credit card bills, etc.) to make payments automatically or track expenses.
User Uploads Bill Image: The user uploads a bill (e.g., a utility bill).
OCR Extraction: The system uses the provided code to extract the text from the bill image.
Bill Details Extraction: The system parses key details from the extracted text, such as Bill Number, Due Date, Amount, and Payee Name.
Data Display and Processing: The extracted data can be displayed to the user or used to automate payments or send reminders for due dates.

Why Tesseract was the Best Option:
Accuracy for Printed Text: Tesseract is one of the most accurate OCR libraries, especially for printed text on bills.
Free and Open-Source: Tesseract is open-source, meaning it is cost-effective and can be freely used in commercial applications.
JavaScript Support: Since the application is built in React, Tesseract.js provides an easy integration in the browser environment for client-side OCR tasks.
Extensibility: Tesseract supports multiple languages and can be trained for specific fonts or text types, which is important for different kinds of bills.
